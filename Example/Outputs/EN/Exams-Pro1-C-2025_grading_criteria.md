## C Programming Exercise 1 Grading Rubric: Weekly Study Tracking

This rubric outlines the criteria for grading the C program designed to track weekly study hours for 5 subjects. The total possible points are 10.

**1. Functional Correctness (4 points)**

*   **4 points:** The program correctly inputs and stores study hours into a 5x7 matrix. It accurately calculates and prints the total study hours per subject. All test cases pass without errors.
*   **3 points:** The program mostly functions correctly, but there are minor errors in input, storage, or calculation of total study hours. Some test cases may fail.
*   **2 points:** The program has significant errors in input, storage, or calculation. The output is incorrect or incomplete. Many test cases fail.
*   **1 point:** The program attempts to implement the required functionality, but it contains major errors and does not produce meaningful output.
*   **0 points:** The program does not compile or does not attempt to implement the required functionality.

**2. Code Quality and Structure (3 points)**

*   **3 points:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It effectively utilizes functions (`loadMatrix`, `printMatrix`, `sumRow`) as specified in the requirements. The code is modular and avoids unnecessary complexity.
*   **2 points:** The code is generally well-structured, but there are some areas where it could be improved for clarity or modularity. The functions are implemented, but their usage could be more effective.
*   **1 point:** The code is poorly structured and difficult to understand. The functions may be missing or implemented incorrectly. There is significant code duplication or unnecessary complexity.
*   **0 points:** The code is unreadable and lacks any discernible structure.

**3. Efficiency and Optimization (2 points)**

*   **2 points:** The code is efficient and avoids unnecessary computations or memory usage. The algorithm is optimized for performance.
*   **1 point:** The code is functional but could be improved for efficiency. There may be some unnecessary computations or memory usage.
*   **0 points:** The code is inefficient and performs unnecessary computations or memory allocations.

**4. Style and Documentation (1 point)**

*   **1 point:** The code is well-formatted and easy to read. It includes meaningful comments that explain the purpose of different code sections. Variable names are descriptive.
*   **0 points:** The code is poorly formatted and difficult to read. It lacks comments or the comments are unhelpful. Variable names are unclear or inconsistent.
